To get started with the Alexa Radio Skill, you will need to set up Firebase, deploy the site on Vercel, and create the Alexa Skill. While these steps may sound complicated, they can easily be completed in about 5 minutes. Just follow the steps and click and copy as needed. Let's get started!

## Setup Firebase
Firebase enables data storage and authentication for our website and their free tier is very generous.

### Step 1 - Create New Firebase Project

Create a new Firebase Project at [console.firebase.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/).

When you create a new Web app, Firebase will create credentials that you can use to access the app from your website. Note the API Key and Project ID, you'll need it when you deploy the website.

### Step 3 - Create database
We will be storing all our data in Firebase and that requires you to create a database. You don't need to add any data, just initialize it so Firebase will provision it for you.
